<h1>osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
<p> This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and guides you through the installation process of the open-source support ticketing system, osTicket.<p />

<h2>What is osTicket?</h2>
osTicket is a free open-source help desk ticketing system companies can use to manage support tickets.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machine)
- [Windows App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windows-app/id1295203466?mt=12) or Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Why Are We Using a Virtual Machine?</h2>

Using a Virtual Machine to test software is a great practice because it keeps the environment of your physical computer clean. It also prevents potential issues during installation from affecting your main system.

<h2>Create Virtual Machine</h2>

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Create a Virtual Machine
   - Use a Windows 10 image to create your VM
   - For VM size, select anything with 2-4 virtual CPUs (vcpus).
   - Save your authentication credentials as you will use them for authenticating later.
